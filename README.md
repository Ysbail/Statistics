# Statistics
Working with statistics using Python, Pandas, Numpy

In this section I store my knowledge and practice my skills related to statistics, exploratory data analysis, scipy packages, stats, sampling, linear regression and others.

I would like to thank all the teachers who pass on their knowledge, both in their own repositories and books or through the DataCamp portal where I am finishing my next courses.
